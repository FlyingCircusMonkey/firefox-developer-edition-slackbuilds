Firefox Browser Developer Edition

The browser made for developers

All the latest developer tools in beta, plus experimental features like the Multi-line Console Editor and WebSocket Inspector.

A separate profile and path so you can easily run it alongside Release or Beta Firefox.

Preferences tailored for web developers: Browser and remote debugging are enabled by default, as are the dark theme and developer toolbar button.

NOTE:
This package is a binary repackaging from the official package.
